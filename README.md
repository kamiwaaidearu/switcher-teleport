Your task is to create a UI that compares two Urban Areas using the free Teleport API:

https://developers.teleport.org/api/

There are three minimum requirements we'd like implemented.

1. User should be able to select two urban areas from the Teleport API to compare.

2. Once two urban areas are selected, present the user with a comparison of the urban areas.

3. Choose at least 5 data points to compare and display those.

Use whatever technology you are most comfortable with to complete this task. Try to spend no more than 90 minutes on this task.
